# Flatcoin Watchlist JS Back End
Welcome to FlatCoin Watchlist JS! This App was develop as a Flatiron School JS project. I developed this app to help users create cryptocurrency watchlists.

# Installation
You may fork this back end repository, but you also need to fork its [front end repository](https://github.com/drivera53/js_watchlist) as well.

# Usage
Run `rails s` to start the server and then open `index.html` form the front end repository. Here you may start creating watchlists and adding your favorite Crytocurrencies. Each watchlist displays a list of all your coins along with valuable updated information such as current price, market cap, circulating supply, logo and many more.
